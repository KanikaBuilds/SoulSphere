    <p class="intro-text">
      SoulSphere didn’t begin with code — it began with a feeling. A need to create a space for voices that go unheard, emotions that feel too heavy, and people who just need to know they're not alone.
    </p>

    <div class="about-journey">
      <h2>🌱 How It Started</h2>
      <p>
        One sleepless night, scrolling through forums and anonymous blogs, our founder realized how powerful just *being heard* could be. That’s when the idea hit — what if there was a single space where anyone, from anywhere, could let it out safely?
      </p>

      <h2>⚙️ How It Works</h2>
      <ul class="about-list">
        <li><strong>Voices of the Crowd (VoC)</strong> — a space to speak your truth, anonymously.</li>
        <li><strong>Wellness Tools</strong> — find balance with breathing guides, meditations, and emotional journaling.</li>
        <li><strong>Help Circle</strong> — peer-led support with real talk and genuine connection.</li>
        <li><strong>Resources</strong> — practical help, expert advice, and emergency support when you need it most.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>💙 Why It Matters</h2>
      <p>
        In a world constantly moving, SoulSphere slows down for you. We believe emotional well-being isn’t a luxury — it’s a human right. And healing isn’t linear, but together, we can walk the path.

      <h3>✉️ A Note from the Creator</h3>
      <p>
        "SoulSphere is a piece of my heart. I built it for the quiet thinkers, the late-night overthinkers, the strong ones who sometimes need a break. If that’s you — welcome home."
